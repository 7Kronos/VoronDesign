Hi. This is part of my bigger project but as i thought this might be helpful for others here it is: Case feeder used mainly for 9x19mm brass cases. Other sizes of brass have not been tested. Use OD 15mm pvc tube to guide cases from droptube to your reloading press.
I run motor at 19 volts from old laptop power supply and motor does not get warm. Case feeder has been tested and was able to feed 4750 cases per hour in full speed.

edit: first JGY370 motor appears to be losing it's ability to start. I am planning to redesign the design to use GW31CT instead. Feeder bucket should not be affected.

edit2: First JGY370 still operational. If you still want to use bigger motor: Base2.stl needed for GW31CT. I also uploaded feeder plate for 8mm motor shaft.

All other parts can be printed without supports but obviously droptube.stl needs them.
I used PETG for bucket and PLA for everything else. You might want to use use 4-5 outer layers when printing feeder plate as motor drive pin will otherwise deform area around it.

Screws used are various lengths of M3 bolts and square nuts. Droptube is attached to body part with M5 bolts and hexagonal nuts.

Motor used is JGY370 12v 3rpm with 6mm shaft. You have to drill 3mm hole thru shaft and use 30-35mm long Ã˜3mm steel pin to drive feeder plate.

Parts bucket_feeder.stl and 9mm_feeder_plate.stl are multibody stl files that can be printed as is if your printer is large enough (300 x 300) or can be split using object/split function in Slic3r. After that they will fit 250 x 210 print area of Prusa MK2S/MK3.

Design uses M3x5.5x2mm square nuts.

edit: I uploaded 9mm_feeder_plate_4pcs.stl, a variant that allows this design to be printed on 200x200mm sized printer.

Part cover.stl is a door where i have made holes for 12mm inductive sensor (
LJ12A3-4-Z-BX NPN) wire(mounted with zipties to droptube), a on/off switch and 5.5*2.1 chassis mount socket and a PWM speed controller
